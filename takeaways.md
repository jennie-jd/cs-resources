Made progress on submitting the first PR to the first-contributions repo.  
Searched some "good first issues" repository but found a lot of repos are not active; I want to find active and good repos.  
Also tried to add colored texts to this github md file, but found that colored texts are not supported.

Got some good suggestions on how to start githubbing. Will try their suggestions to get started. A few key points:
- My No.1 goal is to improve technical skills
- An important aspect of open sourcing is to find the right project
- Find a repo that I am truly interested in, understand it deeply, and keep contributing
- There are setup videos or online courses which may be more helpful than open source in explaining SW development process

After trying a couple times with the first-contributions repo, I am getting a gist of git and feel great about it.  
It's important to understand the git trees as the next step, so I can be confident about making changes whenever using a version control system.

I made another PR to a public repo and got accepted. Feel great to make progress on more achievements!

Found that chatgpt has a gptstore where people can customize gpt and get paid if the user volume is high. I want to try to make some gpt tools - fine-tuning the prompts, just as I did in the artificial intelligence class at school.
