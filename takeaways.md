## Keeping track of my takeaways ðŸ˜Š

_**March 15, 2024**_  
Made progress on submitting the first PR to the first-contributions repo.  
Searched some "good first issues" repository but found a lot of repos are not active; I want to find active and good repos.  
Also tried to add colored texts to this github md file, but found that colored texts are not supported.

Keep going. Kitty says I can do it! ðŸ˜™

Got some good suggestions on how to start githubbing. Will try their suggestions to get started. A few key points:
- My No.1 goal is to improve technical skills
- An important aspect of open sourcing is to find the right project
- Find a repo that I am truly interested in, understand it deeply, and keep contributing
- There are setup videos or online courses which may be more helpful than open source in explaining SW development process

After trying a couple times with the first-contributions repo, I am getting a gist of git and feel great about it.  
It's important to understand the git trees as the next step, so I can be confident about making changes whenever using a version control system.

I made another PR to a public repo and got accepted. Feel great to make progress on more achievements!

Found that chatgpt has a gptstore where people can customize gpt and get paid if the user volume is high. I can try to make some gpt tools.
