## My takeaways along the way

March 15, 2024

Made progress on submitting the first PR to the first-contributions repo.  
Searched some "good first issues" repository but found a lot of repos are not active; I want to find active and good repos.  
Also tried to add colored texts to this github md file, but found that colored texts are not supported.
