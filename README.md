Made progress on submitting the first PR to the first-contributions repo.  
Searched some "good first issues" repository but found a lot of repos are not active; I want to find active and good repos.  
Also tried to add colored texts to this github md file, but found that colored texts are not supported.

Keep going. Kitty says I can do it! ðŸ˜™

Got some good suggestions on how to start githubbing from 1point3acres and xiao hong shu. Will try their suggestions to get started. A few key points:
- my No.1 goal is to improve technical skills
- an important aspect of open sourcing is to find the right project
- find a repo that I am truly interested in, understand it deeply, and keep contributing
- there are setup videos or online courses which may be more helpful than open source in explaining SW development process
